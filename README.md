# Differential Flux Calculator
I wrote this code in the context of an internship at Laboratoire de physique théorique des hautes énergies (LPTHE) of Sorbonne University under the supervision of Dr. Giacomo Cacciapaglia.

## WARNING
No scientific publication may use these results or take parts of the codes without official authorization.

## Repository
It should be noted that this code is configured to use the output files of the public code BlackHawk by Alexandre Arbey and Jérémy Auffinger: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04268v3.

### The repository contains:
- A pdf file of the results explained (in French)
- A Jupyter Notebook with all the computation using BlackHawk data
- A Matematica Notebook reproducing the last plots of the Jupyter Notebook with other methods and presentation

### The project includes the computation and/or vizualisation of:
- Primary and secondary emission rate evolution of particles* from a single black hole
- Primary and secondary emission rate evolution of particles* from a specified distribution of black holes
- Primary and secondary differential flux evolution of particles* from a specified distribution of black holes
- Differential flux evolution comparison of particles* from various distribution of black holes
- Differential flux comparison averaged in time of particles* from various distribution of black holes compared to experimental data from LHAASO
- Mass distribution evolution of the black holes following their evaporation
- Secondary emission rate of particles* from a single black hole for a simplified theoretical model
- Secondary emission rate evolution of particles* from a specified distribution of black holes for a simplified theoretical model
- Secondary differential flux evolution of particles* from a specified distribution of black holes for a simplified theoretical model
